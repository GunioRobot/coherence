Description: Coherence is a framework written in Python,
        providing a variety of UPnP MediaServer and UPnP MediaRenderer implementations
        for instant use. Furthermore it enables your application to participate in
        digital living networks, at the moment primarily the DLNA/UPnP universe.
        
        Its objective and demand is to relieve your application from all the
        membership/the UPnP related tasks as much as possible.
        
        New in this 0.5.8 - Trix and Flix - release
        
        * a MediaServer backend for DVB-Daemon (http://www.k-d-w.org/node/42)
        * exporting atm the stored recordings
        * allowing to delete recordings from within a UPnP client, when enabled on the backend
        * will export EPG data and allow scheduling via UPnP in the future
        * client device and service implementations for BinaryLight and DimmableLight devices
        * rework of the D-Bus support
        * should now be usable from other languages (C,Perl,..) too
        * support for activating/deactivation a backend via D-Bus, allowing for instance to start a MediaServer backend via D-Bus
        * a plugin for Totem (http://www.gnome.org/projects/totem/)
        * enabling Totem to detect and browse UPnP A/V MediaServers
        * using only D-Bus to communicate with a Coherence instance
        * a basic reusable PyGTK based UPnP A/V ControlPoint widget, used in the Totem plugin
        * rework (again) of the XBox 360 support - getting closer
        * our first set of unit tests
        * include a copy of Louie (http://pylouie.org) to solve a setuptools runtime dependency issue and make the life of distribution packagers a bit easier
